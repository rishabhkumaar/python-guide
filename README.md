2. **Official Documentation**

   * Go through the [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) for in-depth understanding.
   * Learn standard libraries like `math`, `datetime`, and `os`.

3. **Style and Best Practices**

   * Read [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) to understand coding standards.
   * Start writing cleaner, readable Python code.

4. **Applied Learning**

   * Work through projects from [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
   * Apply Python to everyday tasks like file handling, automation, or web scraping.

5. **Deep Dive**

   * Explore articles and tutorials on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/).
   * Learn advanced concepts: OOP, decorators, generators, context managers.

6. **Community and Practice**

   * Solve problems on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/).
